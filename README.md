# Video Tweet - A Social Media Platform

## Description
Video Tweet is a platform where users can upload and share videos, tweet, like, and comment on content, create playlists, and follow channels. This project integrates Docker, Jenkins for CI/CD, and is deployed on Render. The application follows the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and is structured with a microservices architecture.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Tweeting**: Create, update, and delete tweets.
- **Video Upload**: Upload videos, manage their details (e.g., thumbnail, publishing status), and like/dislike them.
- **Commenting**: Add, edit, and delete comments on videos.
- **Subscriptions**: Subscribe to channels and manage subscriptions.
- **Playlists**: Create and manage playlists, add or remove videos.
- **Like/Dislike**: Like videos, tweets, or comments.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend API server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user, video, tweet, comment, and subscription data.
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment and portability.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline automation for deployment.
- **Render**: Cloud platform for hosting the application.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to user routes.
- **Multer**: Handling file uploads (avatars, cover images, videos, thumbnails).
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based platform for uploading photos and videos.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **MongoDB** (for database)
- **Jenkins** (for CI/CD automation)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcos-para-garud/mega-project-backend.git
cd backend-mega-project


Step 2: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
Docker Setup
Running the App with Docker
This project uses Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).

Step 1: Install Docker
Make sure you have Docker installed. If not, download Docker and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

Step 2: Set Up Docker-Compose
This project uses Docker Compose to manage multiple containers for the backend, database, and other services.

Build Docker Images
From the project root directory, run the following command to build the Docker images:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
Run the Containers
After building the images, start the containers with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This will start the MongoDB database, Node.js server, and other services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Access the Application
Once the containers are running, the backend API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
